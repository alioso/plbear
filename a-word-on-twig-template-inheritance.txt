Include: dump the contents of that template into this one

Extend: Take the old template and allow me to override blocks defined in the other template - I don't get to redefine everything and I don't get to define new blocks - I just get to suppress the old block definition and redefine it (and then I can dump the parent template's block definiton into my definition if I use {{ parent() }} - kinda like doing an include just of that one block from the parent template's definition into your child template definiton

Embed: Include but then override blocks from that include (super useful for layouts)

Here are a set of examples that I think illustrate the point:

a.html

{% block header %}
<h1>This is from a!</h1>
{% endblock %}
{% block section }
<section>
  Here is some stuff
</section>
{% endblock %}


produces:

<h1>This is from a!</h1>
<section>
  Here is some stuff from a
</section>

b.html

{% extends "a.html" %}
{% block header %}
<h2>This is from b!</h2>
{% endblock %}

produces:

<h2>This is from b!</h2>
<section>
  Here is some stuff from a
</section>

c.html

<h1>This is from c!</h1>
<h2>We're adding lots of stuff</h2>
{% embed 'b.html %}
{% block header %}
<h3>This is overriding the h2 from b and redefining it here in c!</h3>
{% endblock %}
{% endembed %}
<p>And let's just tack on some stuff at the bottom. Just for fun!</p>

produces:

<h1>This is from c!</h1>
<h2>We're adding lots of stuff</h2>
<h3>This is overriding the h2 from b and redefining it here in c!</h3>
<section>
  Here is some stuff from a
</section>
<p>And let's just tack on some stuff at the bottom. Just for fun!</p>
